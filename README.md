Superstore Sales Forecasting & Strategy

I built a sales prediction project for a Superstore using Random Forest & Prophet to forecast daily and category-level sales.

Highlights:

Predicts sales trends and seasonal patterns up to 30 days ahead

Provides actionable stock insights per product category

Interactive visualizations with Plotly & Streamlit for easy data exploration

Handles outliers and feature engineering for improved accuracy

Tech Stack: Python | Pandas | NumPy | Scikit-Learn | Prophet | Plotly | Streamlit

Outcome: Accurate sales forecasts + data-driven stock strategy for better business decisions
